In the Attendance Management System ER Diagram, an example of Strong Entity and 

Weak Entity would be:

Strong Entity:

 Student

o The Student entity can exist independently in the database and has a well-defined 

primary key (StudentID).

Weak Entity:

 Attendance

o The Attendance entity depends on the Student (via StudentID) and 

ClassSchedule (via ScheduleID).

o It does not have a unique primary key of its own that can exist index
o Key Attribute: The attribute which uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set is called the key 

attribute. For example, Roll_No o Composite Attribute: An attribute composed of many other 

attributes is called a composite attribute. For example, the Address attribute of the student Entity 

type consists of Street, City, State, and Country. o Derived Attribute: An attribute that can be derived 

from other attributes of the entity type is known as a derived attribute. e.g.; Age (can be derived 

from DOB) o Multivalued Attribute: An attribute consisting of more than one value for a given entity. 

For example, Phone_No ......for all this also give me example

Here are examples for Key Attribute, Composite Attribute, Derived Attribute, and 

Multivalued Attribute in the context of the Attendance Management System ER 

Diagram:

1. Key Attribute

 Definition: An attribute that uniquely identifies each entity in the set.

 Example:

o In the Student entity, StudentID is the key attribute as it uniquely identifies each 

student.

2. Composite Attribute

 Definition: An attribute composed of multiple other attributes.

 Example:

o Address in the Student entity can be a composite attribute consisting of:

 Street

 City

 State

 Country

3. Derived Attribute

 Definition: An attribute that is calculated or derived from other
. Multivalued Attribute

 Definition: An attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity instance.

 Example:

o In the Student entity, Phone is a multivalued attribute because a student can have 

multiple phone numbers, such as a personal phone and a parent's phone.

These attributes illustrate the diversity in how information is stored and modeled in an ER 

diagram.

Here are additional examples of Key Attribute, Composite Attribute, Derived Attribute, 

and Multivalued Attribute specific to the Attendance Management System (AMS), 

excluding the ones mentioned earlier:

1. Key Attribute

 Definition: An attribute that uniquely identifies each entity in the set.

 Example:

o CourseID in the Course entity uniquely identifies each course in the system.

o ScheduleID in the ClassSchedule entity uniquely identifies each scheduled 

class.

2. Composite Attribute

 Definition: An attribute composed of multiple sub-attributes.

 Example:

o In the Faculty entity, Name can be a composite attribute consisting of:

 FirstName

 MiddleName

 LastName

o In the ClassSchedule entity, TimeSlot could be broken into:

 StartTime

 EndTime

3. Derived Attribute

 Definition: An attribute calculated or derived from other attributes.

 Example:

o In the ClassSchedule entity, Duration can be a derived attribute calculated as:

 EndTime - StartTime

o In the Attendance entity, TotalClassesAttended for a student 
4. Multivalued Attribute
 Definition: An attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity instance.

 Example:

o In the Faculty entity, Specializations can be a multivalued attribute as a 

faculty member might specialize in multiple areas (e.g., AI, Machine Learning, and 

Cloud Computing).

o In the ClassSchedule entity, DaysOfWeek can be a multivalued attribute because 

a class may occur on multiple days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
