Task 5: Writing Join Queries, Equivalent, and/or Recursive Queries

Case Study: Online Food Ordering System

Objective: To perform advanced query processing and test its heuristics by designing 

optimized complex queries and their equivalent forms, including recursive queries, for the 

Online Food Ordering System.

1. Join Queries

Query 1: Retrieve all orders along with the corresponding customer's name.

Expected Output:

Query 2: Retrieve all menu items along with the restaurant name that offers them.

Expected Output:

Query 3: Retrieve all orders and their delivery status.
Expected Output:

INNER JOIN

An INNER JOIN retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.

Query: Retrieve all orders along with their customer names.

Expected Output:

LEFT OUTER JOIN

A LEFT OUTER JOIN retrieves all records from the left table and the matched records 

from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for columns from the right table.

Query: Retrieve all customers, even those who havenâ€™t placed any orders.
